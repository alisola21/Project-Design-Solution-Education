A project of Project Design &amp; Management for Data Science (carried out in a team of 4 people) on the creation of a solution for solving a problem related to the educational field.   

In particular, following the various **phases** of Project Design (Identification of users and their needs, identification of the solution and testing using pretotyping techniques) it was looked for a solution able to solve the **reading problems of students with visual impairments**, creating a pretotype application (called "*Easy Read*") that assists students during reading, adapting the characteristics of the text to their needs, thus improving their experience and helping them in their education.
